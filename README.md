Hi!
This is a recipe of my favourite sweet dish Ras-malai.
It is a soft milk cake floting in the sweet milky syrup.
This delicious, mouth watering sweet dish is from Bengal.
Bengal, is extremely popular and proud of their milk based mithais and rasmalai is one of those delicacies.
A good rasmalai is supposed to be soft, spongy, sweet and satisfying .
